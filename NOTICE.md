# The Name "Intender"

The name “Intender” is used here as an informal mark to identify this project and its associated vision.
Please avoid using the same or confusingly similar names in derivative projects, especially for commercial use.
This request is made in the spirit of mutual respect.

— Jonathan Moregård, creator of Intender

# Why AGPL?

This project uses the AGPL-3.0 license to make sure that if someone builds on this work—especially for web-based or distributed versions—they also share their changes under the same terms.

The goal is to encourage improvement and remixing, while preventing rebranded or commercial forks that don’t give anything back.

Thanks for respecting these requests. If you're building something inspired by Intender, I’d love to hear about it.
