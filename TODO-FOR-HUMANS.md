# TODO (For Humans) - AI kept using as scratchpad before name change

## Pre beta test

- Check icon, should there be diff sizes as in the sample ext?
- Make a "CD" - build artefact to stable link AND a install guide for testers with the link
- Finish fuzzy match logic
- clean up design of settings page (https://chatgpt.com/share/68930b96-3600-8003-b0ca-bf15351deafc)
  - where do added example intentions go/dissapear when adding?
  - what is a clearer layout order that screams purpose?

## Maybe pre beta

- Quick add current website button
- Built-in bug report button (if easy)

# FUTURE- reasses post user interview

## Revenue & Marketing

- Collect (locally stored) metrics on use and use to drive donations (you have avoided rabbit hoes 1k ties, do you want to send me some cash?) - lookup best practices
  - show on dashbord with info about data sharing
- Add "share button" for users to share either extension, or specific intentions, with a link to the app in marketplace (after v1 - needs to have a link)
- paid addons?
  - dark mode (with total vibe makeover)

## Settings

- search/filter
- undo/redo

## UX Improvements

- Show # unparseable intention urls on the extension icon somehow
- power users & a11y review
- Add loading states, error handling

## Technical

- Add proper error handling throughout
- e2e tests
- Maybe: privacy policy, terms of service
