# TODO

## Revenue & Marketing

- Collect metrics on use and use to drive donations (you have avoided rabbit hoes 1k ties, do you want to send me some cash?) - lookup best practices
- Add "share button" for users to share either extension, or specific intentions, with a link to the app in marketplace (after v1 - needs to have a link)

## UX Improvements

- Add templates, search/filter
- Add keyboard shortcuts, undo/redo
- Add intention validation, statistics
- power users & a11y review

## Visual & Assets

- Improve popup design and functionality
- Add loading states, error handling
- Add dark mode, accessibility improvements

## Technical

- Add proper error handling throughout
- Add logging, analytics, performance monitoring
- Add automated testing, CI/CD
- Add documentation, security audit
- Add privacy policy, terms of service
- Look over format/handling of "url" in intention - currently a bit of a mess
