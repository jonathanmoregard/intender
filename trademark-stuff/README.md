# Trademark Stuff

ChatGPT made me do it.

Actually, it was more like "you should probably think about trademark protection for your project name" and I was like "yeah, that sounds like a good idea" and now here we are.

This folder contains various trademark-related documents, screenshots, and whatever else I end up putting here while figuring out how to protect the "Intender" name.

## Contents

- Screenshots of various searches and registrations
- Notes about trademark classes and jurisdictions
- Whatever else seems relevant

## Why?

Because apparently having a cool project name means you need to think about legal stuff. Who knew?
